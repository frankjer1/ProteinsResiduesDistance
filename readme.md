# Protein Chains Links calculator

Hello everyone!
This simple project let the user understand where are the links between protein chains valutating the distances between ther residues.
It takes as input a .pdb file (Protein Data Bank file), then asks the user to choose the first chain and then the second chain to analyze. The user can also analyze combined chains(ex. links between A and B + C). The script return a .txt file and a .csv file with all the presumed links of the valutated chains.
